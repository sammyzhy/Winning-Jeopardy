    "\n",
    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to compete on Jeopardy, and we're looking for any edge we can get to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions. Here's the beginning of the file:\n",
    "![](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/Nlfu13A.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:\n",
    "   + Show Number -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "   + Air Date -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "   + Round -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "   + Category -- the category of the question.\n",
    "   + Value -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "   + Question -- the text of the question.\n",
    "   + Answer -- the text of the answer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "First, we'll explore the dataset."
